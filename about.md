I'm Octave. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Kent, working within the [Programming Languages and Systems group](https://research.kent.ac.uk/programming-languages-systems/).

I do Programming Language Implementation, and I focus on AST interpreter performance. We recently got a paper accepted at OOPSLA which summarizes well why my PhD topic is not a waste of time ([AST vs. Bytecode: Interpreters in the Age of Meta-Compilation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622808))

Otherwise, my many interests include obsessively climbing big rocks, playing hard videogames and being a slightly above average cook
